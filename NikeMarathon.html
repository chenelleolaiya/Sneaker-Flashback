                <h3>Nike Marathon</h3>
                <p> During the 1970s in America, there was a dramatic increase in competitive jogging and road running. This era is often referred to as the ‘Running boom of the 1970s.’ An estimated 25 million Americans, most notably President Jimmy Carter, participated in running activities. Because 1970s running became the most fashionable types of active leisure, there was an increase the demand of durable running trainers. It was due to this demand, that the history of Nike began.
                </p>
                <p> Prior to the 1970s, the athletic footwear market was dominated by brands such as Onitsuka Tiger, Adidas, Keds, Chuck Taylor of Converse, and New Balance. However, it was Nike the newcomer who quickly took control, by using innovative materials and designs. This most certainly triggered the evolution of modern day running shoes.
                </p>
                <p> Made in Japan, the Nike Marathon was one of the first Nike running shoe to feature a nylon upper which allowed for a light weight build. Compared to sneakers of today, the design characteristics of the Nike Marathon is simple looking. However, back in 1972, it was considered to be technologically advanced. This is because a key innovation of this shoe was the heel counter. The heel counter reduced shock absorption by the foot. Therefore, the Nike Marathon played an influential role in Nike’s running shoe history.
