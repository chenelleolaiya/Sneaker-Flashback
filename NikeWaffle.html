              <h3>Nike Waffle</h3>
              <p> Often mistaken as the Nike Cortez, the waffle trainer was first introduced in 1974. The following year, the shoe was modified, featuring a flared outsole added for enhanced stabilization. The UCLA colorway was issued in 1976. A notable feature of the Waffle Trainer is its waffle-iron on the outside of the shoe which created by Bill Bowerman. 
              </p>
              <p> Often known as ‘Nike’s Original Innovator’, Bowerman was born in 1911 in Oregon and demonstrated exceptional talent as an athlete at the University of Oregon. He became Oregon’s track coach after returning home from serving in World War II. Bowerman career spanned over two decades, where he coached 31 Olympians, 22 NCAA Champions and led the university to 4 NCAA track titles. However, he was dissatisfied with the running shoes that he had seen because the soles were flat and lower to the ground. Bowerman’s answer to this problem has been labelled by Nike historian Scott Reames as ‘the Breakfast Epiphany’. 
              </p>
              <p> One morning in 1971, Bill was having breakfast with his wife, Barbara. She used an old waffle iron to make breakfast which played an influential role in the design of Nike waffle trainers. This is because Bill suddenly realised that the grooves in the waffle iron would be the perfect mould for a running shoe. In an interview conducted by Reames, Barbara stated that interview he conducted for the company in 2006, The Oregonian reports. "We were making the waffles that morning and talking about (the track). As one of the waffles came out, he said, 'You know, by turning it upside down — where the waffle part would come in contact with the track — I think that might work.' As shown in the left picture, you can clearly see that the soles of the shoe resemble the grooves of a waffle iron. Thus, the Nike waffle trainer was born.
