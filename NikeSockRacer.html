                <h3>Nike Marathon</h3>
                <p> Released in 1985, the Air Sock Racer was first released in 1985, the Air Sock Racer was at the time, Nike's most innovative shoe. Its design featured a four-way stretch open weave mesh, woven synthetic mesh upper, polyurethane midsole and two synthetic suede straps that replaced laces. Designer Bruce Kilgore gave these sneakers a very bold colourway, using black and yellow.
                </p>
                <p> The Norwegian runner, Ingrid Kristiansen, debuted these shoes at the 1986 Olympic trials. This shows that these sneakers were designed specifically for runners which is why it was designed to be a very lightweight shoe. According to Nike.com, this lightweight design meant that the shoe required a break-in period. This would best achieved with a pair of lightweight socks. Wilson Smith designed a pair socks which matched the colourway of the shoes. These were known as ‘Bee Socks’. Anyone who purchased the Nike Sock Racer when it had initially been launched, were given these socks for free. 
                </p>
                <p> The influence of these sneakers can be seen in some of the most innovation and iconic runners of today. This includes the sock dart and the Air Presto. Its influence is also demonstrated in the many of the Flyknit trainers. The sock darts, Air Prestos and Flyknits are sold in many stores including: Foot Locker, the Nike store, and Foot Asylum.
